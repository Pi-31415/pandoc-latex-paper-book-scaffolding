There will need to be a member system for the Editors, Restricted Editors, and Users of the website. Public Visitors to the website can enter the pages Each of the four categories of visitors are defined below. 

Editors: Persons who can make direct edits to the website 
Four core members of ASsist
Bin Azhar Abdullah
Chan Jing Lin Stephanie
Leung Hoi Yan Holly
Mak Lai Hang Colin
Persons appointed by ASsist

Restricted Editors: Persons who can make edits to the website, but the edits will need to be approved by the Editors before the edits are published 
Staff of organisations involved with refugees and asylum seekers (“NGOs”)
Christian Action
Branches of Hope
Refugee Concern Network
Refugee Union
Volunteers of ASsist (“VA”)
University students
Academics

Users: Those who have an account on the website. After logging onto their account, users can communicate with each other through instant messaging and can communicate with Editors through message bots akin to customer service bots
Members/Volunteers from I Am Not a Criminal (“INC”)
Refugees and Asylum Seekers (“RAS”)
Please advise on whether it would be viable to have the Users make accounts on the website through providing their emails, such that Users can receive notifications from the website (e.g. If someone has messaged them) through email. 

Public Visitors: Persons who can view content on the website without an account 
*Content accessible to Public Visitors will also be available to Users, Editors, and Restricted Editors regardless of whether they have logged onto their accounts 

Components:
Pages containing information in the form of text, pictures, videos, downloadable pdfs/word documents
Editors and VA are allowed to edit the pages
Accessible to Public Visitors
Calendar of events
Editors and NGOs are allowed to edit the Calendar
RAS can access the Calendar and sign up for events posted
Function of the Calendar
NGOs will post events relevant to RAS on the Calendar. The events will be approved by the Editors. 
After logging onto their accounts, RAS can sign up for the events. As RAS can see all the times in which events from different NGOs are taking place, the RAS can choose which event to sign up for.
NGOs will receive the information of the RAS who signed up such that the NGOs can better accommodate/coordinate with the RAS
The Calendar function can be sculpted like the model used on the website of Hands on HK (https://www.handsonhongkong.org/calendar?layoutViewMode=tablet)
However, it would be preferable if the Calendar on our website is more user friendly and easier to read. The HOHK calendar is a little too big and the events cannot all be seen in one instance. The phone version of the website also has the same problem.
Messages between Users
After logging onto their accounts, Users can communicate with each other through instant messaging 
RAS can communicate with other RAS
RAS can also communicate with INC
INC can also communicate with INC, but it is unlikely that INC will need to do so as they likely have other methods of communication
The messages are not anonymous; first names of INC and RAS will be available to the person they message
Editors will be able to monitor the messages
Users should be able to upload pdfs, audios, and pictures in their messages
Please advise on what should be set as the maximum capacity
Messages to Editors
Accessible to Public Visitors, who will remain anonymous to the Editors
Users who message the Editors after logging into their account will have their first name displayed to Editors

>For certain common messages, the messages can be answered by a customer service bot. But questions that cannot be answered by the bot will be redirected to the Editors. Public Visitors are advised by the bot to leave their emails such that Editors can reply by email
